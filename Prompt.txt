• Online Auction System: In this project, you are asked to design a data management system for an online auction system like eBay.
Every user has a first name, last name, password, date of birth and social security number. A user can be an admin, buyer, or seller.
 Each seller has an IBAN stored. Each buyer is associated with at least one payment information. A payment information can belong to only one buyer. 
For a payment information credit card number, expiration date, account holder’s name and address are stored. An auction is created by a seller.
 An auction should be accepted by one admin before it can function. (System should store the information about which admin accepted which auction.)
 Each auction has a starting date, ending date, title, description, status, starting price, current price and a “buy it now” price.
 Status can be “Not Accepted”, “Ongoing” or “Finished”. Each auction should belong to a category. Each category has a name and can be related to many auctions. 
An auction can have many bids by buyers. Each bid is associated with one buyer, and the bidding price is stored along. A buyer can bid an auction many times. 
Current price of an auction will be calculated based on the maximum bidder of that auction. 
An auction finishes when a buyer uses the “buy it now” option, or when we reach its ending date.
(In the project, to make it simpler, you can use a manual “end the auction” button.) 
The highest bidder wins the auction. The highest bidder will choose one of his or her payment information to pay the item.
 After the auction is finished a bill is created. Each bill has a unique transaction number as well as a net amount.
 (The company gets 8% commission from the selling price.) 
Each bill is related to only one seller, a seller can be associated to many bills.
